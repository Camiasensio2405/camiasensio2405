## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Camila Asensio, I am 19 years old, and throughout my life, I have taken the time to develop various skills, allowing me to expand my knowledge. This has led me to take an interest in different environments, such as sports, including soccer, basketball, squash, volleyball, and swimming. Additionally, I am passionate about music, as I am able to play three musical instruments. My interests also extend to gastronomy, writing, technological skills, among others.

Currently, I am studying at Hult International Business School, where I am in my first year. At this moment, as I am taking CM3 (Future Proofing), I am particularly interested in developing my skills in computer science. I strongly believe that technology will be a fundamental resource for all businesses in the future, so understanding and mastering it is undoubtedly my goal.
